        <div class="text">The legendary great white shark is far more fearsome in our imaginations than in reality. As scientific research
          on these elusive predators increases, their image as mindless killing machines is beginning to fade. Of the 100-plus
          annual shark attacks worldwide, fully one-third to one-half are attributable to great whites. However, most of
          these are not fatal, and new research finds that great whites, who are naturally curious, are "sample biting" then
          releasing their victims rather than preying on humans. It's not a terribly comforting distinction, but it does
          indicate that humans are not actually on the great white's menu. Great whites are the largest predatory fish on
          Earth. They grow to an average of 15 feet in length, though specimens exceeding 20 feet and weighing up to 5,000
          pounds have been recorded. They have slate-gray upper bodies to blend in with the rocky coastal sea floor, but
          get their name from their universally white underbellies. They are streamlined, torpedo-shaped swimmers with powerful
          tails that can propel them through the water at speeds of up to 15 miles per hour. They can even leave the water
          completely, breaching like whales when attacking prey from underneath.</div>

          mainly on juveniles. As these sharks mature, the lines begin to fade and almost disappear. Shark Attacks These
          large, blunt-nosed predators have a duly earned reputation as man-eaters. They are second only to great whites
          in attacking people. But because they have a near completely undiscerning palate, they are not likely to swim away
          after biting a human, as great whites frequently do. They are consummate scavengers, with excellent senses of sight
          and smell and a nearly limitless menu of diet items.</div>
